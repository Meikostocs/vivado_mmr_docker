# üöÄ Run Vivado in Docker

## üì¶ Installation

Clone the repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:Meikostocs/vivado_mmr_docker.git
cd vivado_mmr_docker
```

# Vivado Docker Setup Guide

## üì¶ Setup

The `setup.sh` script prepares your Docker workspace. It will automatically create the following directories:

- `installer/`: where the Vivado installer will be placed  
- `vivado/`: mapped to `/opt/` in the Docker container (recommended location for your Vivado installation and projects)

---

### üìÅ Step 1: Add the Vivado Installer

Once the `installer/` directory has been created, move your **Vivado installer** file inside it.

Then make sure to:


1. Make it executable:

    ```bash
    chmod +x vivado.bin
    ```

2. Extract its contents to the current directory:

    ```bash
    ./vivado.bin --noexec --target ./
    ```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Replace `vivado.bin` with the actual filename of your Vivado installer if different.

---

### üöÄ Step 2: Launch the Container

Return to the main project directory and run:

```bash
./run.sh
```

- On first launch, you may be prompted to enter your **AMD credentials** (used to validate or download files).  
- After authentication, the installation will proceed automatically.

---

### ‚úÖ Next Runs

Once the setup is complete, any future call to `./run.sh` will directly open Vivado inside the Docker container.

Your Vivado projects should be saved inside the `/opt/` directory (mapped to `vivado/` locally), ensuring that all your work is persistent across container sessions.


---

## üìÅ Directory Structure

- `vivado/` ‚Üí This is mounted to `/opt` inside the Ubuntu container.  
  It is recommended to install Vivado **and store your projects** in `/opt` so they will be available under the `vivado/` folder on your host.

- `installer/` ‚Üí This should contain the Vivado installer binary (e.g., `Vivado_2023.2.bin`).


---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Container

Once everything is set up, run:

```
./run.sh
```

This will open an interactive shell inside the container.

If it's your first time launching it, you'll need to install Vivado manually. From inside the container:

1. Run the installer script (`Vivado_2023.2.bin`) and follow the on-screen instructions.
2. **Important:** Install Vivado into `/opt/` to ensure the installation is persistent.
3. Once installed, navigate to the Vivado binary folder and launch it:

```
cd /opt/Vivado/<version>/bin/
./vivado
```

---

## üí° Usage Tips

- To open Vivado in the future, just run:

```
./run.sh
```
- Navigate into ```/opt/Vivado/<version>/bin/``` folder and launch ```vivado```.
- Save all your projects inside `/opt` (which maps to `vivado/` on the host) to keep them safe and persistent.
- The container has X11 forwarding enabled, so Vivado will open graphically if your host is properly configured.
